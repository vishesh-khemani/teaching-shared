# Polls

- Student engagement is important in my class. Why? 
  - To enable students to actively construct their own knowledge graph instead of passively receiving knowledge
- Part of your grade is allocated to individual engagement (as described in my [Teaching Style](./teaching-style.md))
- Additionally, I'll often poll the entire class to answer something in real time (ungraded). Why?
  - As a formative assessement to gather real-time feedback on the class's grasp (so that I can shape the ongoing lesson as needed)
- I'll use an online tool to conduct these formative polls (instead of simply using a show of hands). Why?
  - To gather real-time stats
  - To increase participation (especially for the shy among us)
