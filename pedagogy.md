# Pedagogy

Here are some of the pedagogical ideas I'll employ in my teaching. This is based on the book "Small Teaching" by James Lang.

## Knowledge

> Help students develop a rich body of knowledge. This is the foundation for higher order thinking

1. Predicting

> Research: our brains are prediction-making machines and our learning stems from the feedback loop of making predictions and then adjusting our mental models in light of the accuracy of those predictions

- Activities prior to introducing a new topic
  - MS Teams poll app in chat
  - Oral discussion
  - Ungraded pretest on Canvas

1. Retrieving

> Research: practicing retrieving information helps you remember the information
>
> "We remember what we think about"

- Activities
  - Start of class quiz on previous class's material
    - Tip: better if students write short answers instead of picking from multiple choice 
  - Opening question: "Before we discuss B, can anyone remind the class about A"
    - Ask the students to use memory, not notes, to answer opening/closing questions
  - Closing question: "Can anyone share some key things they learned in class today"
  - Retrieving Syllabus: ask students to recall a previous class from the syllabus

3. Interleaving

> Research: promote long-term retention with:
>
> 1. **spacing** out learning sessions over time (ala spaced repetition)
> 2. **interleaving** multiple topics instead of one at a time

- Activities
  - Reserve a small part of each quiz to test older material
  - Design questions that require students to draw on older material in light of the new material 

## Understanding

> Comprehend and apply acquired knowledge effectively

1. Connecting

   > “The knowledge in our minds consists of neuronal networks in our brains, so if that knowledge is to grow, the neuronal networks must physically change. This is the change that a teacher wants to create. It is change in connections…unless there is some change in connections, no learning can occur” (Zull 2002)

   - Activities
     - *Mindmapping*: give the students a concept and ask them to mind map its connections to other concepts
     - Prompt students to give *examples*, *analogies*, *reasons*

2. Practicing

> Students should have frequent opportunities to practice in class whatever cognitive skills that you want them to master, and that you will be assessing for a grade.

- Students practicing on their own (e.g. as a homework) is not good enough

- Activities
  - 10m practice session after each topic's direct instruction


3. Explaining

   > learners benefit from explaining out loud (to themselves or a teacher) what they are doing during the completion of a learning task.

   - Activities
     - Peer instruction (Eric Mazur)
       1. Pose a question (as a Teams chat poll) that requires thinking or problem-solving skills
       2. The students take a minute or two to attempt to solve the problem or answer the question on their own and to answer the poll
       3. The students then are asked to take a few minutes to turn to a neighbor and explain their answer. Mazur asks students to find a neighbor with a different answer, which means that they can't just agree with one another quickly and be done.
       4. The students then resubmit their answers, which again are immediately visible to the instructor. The instructor asks a few students to provide their explanations for their answers to the whole room and provides the correct answer.

## Inspiration

1. Belonging

   > Convince each student that they belong in my classroom and the classroom will be worse off without them

   - Activities
     - Start of quarter: each student submits what assets they bring to the course (academic strengths, experiences, unique perspectives, ...)
     - Normalize help-seeking behavior e.g. by awarding engagement points for seeking help
   
2. Motivating

   > Activate emotions of curiosity and purpose in my students
   >
   > Activate emotions of enthusiasm and compassion in myself

   - Activities
     - Open with wonder: before start of class display something relevant and ask what they notice or wonder
     - Open with stories
     - Organize the lesson plan as a story
     - Invoke purpose: keep circling back to why the students are learning what they're learning
