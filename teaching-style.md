# Teaching Style

## My Commitment To You

1. I'll foster a safe, respectful, and engaged learning environment that facilitates robust discussions/questions ala the Socratic method (even for the introverts among us)
2. I'll employ well-researched pedagogical techniques to help you develop a rich body of knowledge, with deep understanding and appreciation
3. I'll teach at a level (and provide variations) so that each of you feels challenged just enough (without finding the class too easy or too hard)
4. I'll strive to make each of you feel like you belong in the class, and that the class will be poorer without the benefit of your unique experience, background, and strengths
5. I'll be accessible and approachable. Please talk to me! ðŸ˜€


## What I Ask Of You

1. You'll engage with the course to the best of your abilities and circumstances
2. You'll put in the work to keep up with the cadence of the course and reach out to me in advance for any exceptions
3. You'll demonstrate your own honest understanding of the topics in all assessments. This point warrants some clarification:
   - You should fully understand, and be able to verbally explain, all work that you submit
   - Although it's not feasible to prohibit you from using AI, I do ask that if you choose to use it, you use it in a limited and judicious way. 
     - What's ok? Looking up related information that you're allowed to access to answer a question (with AI just making it more convenient to access). Here are some examples:
       - "How do I read from a text file in Java"
       - "How do I convert my markdown file into pdf"
     - What's not ok? Using AI to directly answer a question. Here are some examples:
       - "Implement the foo method in the attached Java class"
       - "Answer the questions in the attached file"
     - Why limit the use of AI when it's used in professional environments nowadays?
       - For the same reason you learn to do arithmetic by hand, despite calculators: to *put your brain through the work of learning new concepts, thereby building neural connections for deeper, lasting knowledge*
       - See https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/ for one recent study on this


## Grading

### Weighting of Evaluation Components

| Weight | Group                    |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| 60%    | Assignments (weekly)     |
| 30%    | Quizzes (every class)    |
| 10%    | Engagement (every class) |

What, no midterms or finals? Indeed, and here's why:

- Continuous evaluation (through quizzes and engagement) provides ongoing visibility into whether you're on track (wihout surprises in the middle or end of the course)
- Such continuous evaluation also removes the risks of high-stakes exams by allowing you to have bad days without any significant hit on your grade
- Deeper evaluation than what's possible with quizzes/engagement can still happen in the weekly assignments
- In your professional life you will be evaluated continuously
- I want you to enjoy the learning process, not stress about it

But wait, won't this unfairly lead to the stronger students not getting a better grade than the not-as-strong students? No, and here's why:

- As the course progresses I will adjust the challenge level of graded work as needed to ensure that the grades accurately reflect each student's grasp of the material
- So, for example, if everyone aces a quiz then the next quiz will be harder, and, if everyone tanks a quiz, the next quiz will be easier

### Scale

The tentative scale to convert your overall course percentage (p) into a GPA is the following:

- $\text{GPA}(0 \le p \lt 60) = 0.0$
- $\text{GPA}(60 \le p \lt 93) = 0.7 + (p - 60)/10$
- $\text{GPA}(93 \le p) = 4.0$

| GPA  | Percentage |
| :--- | :--------- |
| 4.0  | $\ge 93$   |
| 3.0  | 83         |
| 2.0  | 73         |
| 1.0  | 63         |
| 0.7  | 60         |
| 0.0  | $\lt 60$   |

The above scale is **subject to change** when I determine the final grades. So please don't game your grade (e.g. by choosing to skip an assignment and still earn your target GPA) because the cut offs may change. Your best strategy is to do your best.

## Evaluation Components

1. Weekly **assignments**
   - New assignment available before the start of the last class of the week
   - **Due before the start of class** 1 week later
     - **No extensions** (since I'll likely discuss the solution in class)
     - But, you can **ask in advance to be excused** if you have a valid reason 
   - Worth **60%** of the grade
     - Excused assignments not included in the scoring
     - Lowest score dropped in the scoring
   - We'll use GitHub Classroom to manage assignments. See [here](./gh-classroom.md) for more details on that
   - Policies
     - You're welcome (even encouraged) to collaborate with your fellow students and ask for help from me
     - For your own good, **don't use AI to solve** the assignments
       - Why not? See the "What I Ask Of You" section above
2. **Quizzes**
   - **10m** quiz in every class, starting at 5m after the start of class
     - **Closed book** to exercise retrieval
     - **On paper** to remove distractions (temptations?)
       - You have to be physically present
       - **Make up** quiz during office hours (in person)
    - Covers the main topics from the previous class (and interleaves older topics as well)
    - Worth **30%** of the grade
      - Excused quizzes not included in the scoring
      - Lowest score dropped in the scoring
3. **Engagement**

   - Evaluated subjectively every week over classes/office-hours
   - You can earn up to 2 points per week. How?
     - *Ask or answer an insightful question in class or in office-hours that week*
   - Fairness: I'll rotate participation opportunities among students 
   - Transparency: The weekly engagement score will be tracked as a no-submission weekly assignment in Canvas
    - Worth **10%** of the grade


## Class Breakdown

Here's a tentative schedule for each class. I'll employ some of the pedagogical techniques described [here](./pedagogy.md).
